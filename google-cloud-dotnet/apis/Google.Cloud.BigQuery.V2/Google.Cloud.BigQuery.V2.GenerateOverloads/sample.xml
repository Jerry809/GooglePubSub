<!--
 - The region label is used to identify the generated source code.
 - It's only used in #region pragmas, but is conventionally the method name
 - and any differentiating features (if there are multiple methods which vary by
 - argument types other than the targeting part).
 -
 - The target type must be Table, Dataset, Job or empty. If it's empty, only two overloads
 - are generated.
 -
 - The return type must be specified, even if it's void.

    - Within comments:
    - - {target} is replaced by "the specified dataset", or "the specified dataset within this client's project" etc.
    - - For delegating methods, a line is added at the end of the summary to indicate the delegation.
    -
    - For asynchronous methods, the summary has "Asynchronously" prepended (and the first letter lower-cased). The returns comment has
    - "A task representing the asynchronous operation. When complete, the result is " prepended, and the first letter lower-cased.
    -
    - Any comment element not specifically processed is copied verbatim.
    - <param> elements are not required for the target datasetId etc, the options or the cancellation token for async methods.
