The `Google.Cloud.Spanner.V1` package provides low-level access to the Google Cloud Spanner API.
This is not recommended for most scenarios. Where possible, use the
[Spanner ADO.NET provider](../Google.Cloud.Spanner.Data/) instead. (That in turn depends on this package,
but provides a much more user-friendly API, and takes care of a lot of resource management automatically.)
